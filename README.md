# Microcontroller-Programming
Programs written for the ARM TM4C123GH6PM microcontroller launchpad.

Written using the Kiel ÂµVision version 4.74 and tested using TExaS (Test Execute and Simulate) software (simulator).

These programs were written while I did the MOOC: *Embedded Systems - Shape The World: Microcontroller Input/Output* developed by the UT Austin on EdX. Most of the programs are labs required for the course and some are codes written by me for pseudocodes/flowcharts discussed in class to teach about topics.
